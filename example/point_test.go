// FAQ: How do I know whether a variable is allocated on the heap or the stack?
// From a correctness standpoint, you don't need to know. Each variable in Go exists as long as there are references to it.
// The storage location chosen by the implementation is irrelevant to the semantics of the language.
//
// The storage location does have an effect on writing efficient programs. When possible, the Go compilers will allocate
// variables that are local to a function in that function's stack frame.
// However, if the compiler cannot prove that the variable is not referenced after the function returns, then the
// compiler must allocate the variable on the garbage-collected heap to avoid dangling pointer errors. Also, if a local
// variable is very large, it might make more sense to store it on the heap rather than the stack.
//
// In the current compilers, if a variable has its address taken, that variable is a candidate for allocation on the heap.
// However, a basic escape analysis recognizes some cases when such variables will not live past the return from the function and can reside on the stack.
func TestPointNew(t *testing.T) {
	// new a pointer pointed to int.
	ptr := new(int)
	*ptr = 3
	fmt.Println(*ptr)
}
